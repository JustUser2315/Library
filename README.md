The 'Library' Java Core Project is a web application that enables users to manage their own personal library. 
This project is built using only Java Core and several additional libraries, including Tomcat, Servlet API, JSP, Jakarta-Servlet-JSP.JSTL, and PostgreSQL Driver.

The main feature of this project is the ability for users to add and delete books from their personal library. 
The project also includes login and logout functionality, and a WebFilter that restricts user access to admin functions. 
The two roles included in this project are admin and general user, with the admin role having full access to user libraries and the ability to delete users.

One of the standout features of the Library project is its internationalization and localization capabilities. 
Users can switch between English and Ukrainian languages to provide a more personalized experience.
